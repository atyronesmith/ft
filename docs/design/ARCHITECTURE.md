2. **Modular Architecture**: Plugin system for datasets, models, and training methods
3. **Simple Configuration**: Single train.yml for all parameters, separate passwords.yml for secrets
4. **Progressive Disclosure**: Simple defaults with advanced options available
5. **Offline-First**: Full functionality without internet after initial model download
6. **Resource-Aware**: Automatic adaptation to available memory and compute

This architecture provides a robust foundation for a fine-tuning application that can handle everything from small BERT models to large LLMs, optimized specifically for Apple Silicon acceleration.
